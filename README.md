# PiCompressing
Theoretically compressing files to near 100%.

#How?
Because of Pi being infinte and never repeating all possible combinations of 1 nad 0s are there, meaning all files are inside pi somewhere!

#What does this mean?
This means 1TB could be compressed to maybe a 1 megabyte, which is about 0.000001% of it's original size.

#Problems
Maybe of biggest problem is that our computers are not fast enough to do this with current algorithms (ex: Chudnovsky).
My current approach is quite bad because it takes hours just to compress just a few letters, but is interesting nonetheless.

#How to fix the problems?
I'm not completely sure, but i'm definitly going to update my search method and maybe my pi calculation to a BBP algorithm.
